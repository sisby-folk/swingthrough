This mod discards the block crosshair target to allow an entity to be targeted instead, when:
   - The block has empty collision
   - The entity is living and attackable
   - You're not directly riding the entity
   - The entity isn't your own tamed entity
   - The entity is within reach (*slightly* longer than actual attack range, but still usable)

The block outline will visually disappear when you're targeting the entity instead.

## Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of play and vanilla content.
